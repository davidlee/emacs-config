;;; dl-umbriel-model.el --- Pure model of a umbriel snapshot -*- lexical-binding: t; -*-

;; The model turns the parsed umbriel snapshots into the data and one-line
;; strings a presentation layer draws: workspaces paired with their windows,
;; the selector that addresses a workspace, and the labels a user reads.
;;
;; Everything here is pure -- parsed alists in, data or strings out -- so it
;; can be tested without a compositor and reused by any front end.  No
;; process, buffer or input is touched.
;;
;; Entries are alists in the shape DEC-013 parses out of the wire: JSON
;; false, null and `[]' all arrive as nil, so every read is `alist-get' with
;; a default (`""' for strings, `-1' for positions and `index', nil for
;; flags).  A field renamed upstream degrades a label instead of signalling,
;; and no entry -- even an empty one -- makes a function here signal.
;;
;; Ordering is expressed as sort keys, one list per entry, and `sort' with
;; `:key' compares them with `value<': lists lexicographically, numbers
;; numerically, strings with `string<'.  Sorting is stable and copies, so a
;; tie keeps input order and no caller's list is mutated.
;;
;; Two addressing fields are not interchangeable.  The join between a window
;; and its workspace uses the workspace's opaque `id'; an action addresses a
;; workspace by its selector, the `name' when `named' (even when it is all
;; digits) else the `index', always qualified by its `output'.  Windows are
;; addressed by their own opaque `id'.  Flattening is a display rule only:
;; the join and the selector read raw values.
;;
;; The wire's `window_count' is never read: a workspace's window count is
;; the number of windows the join placed under it, so label and rows agree.
