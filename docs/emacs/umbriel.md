# umbriel client

umbriel is the Wayland compositor this config runs under. Emacs talks to it
over its IPC (inter-process communication) socket, from four files in
`apps/`:

| File | Owns |
| --- | --- |
| `dl-umbriel.el` | the socket client: requests, the event stream, held state, failure kinds |
| `dl-umbriel-model.el` | pure functions: grouping, labels, workspace selectors |
| `dl-umbriel-columns.el` | pure layout of cells into aligned columns |
| `dl-umbriel-buffer.el` | the `*umbriel*` buffer, row actions, global commands |
| `dl-umbriel-focus.el` | focusing the frame `emacsclient` reuses |

Only `dl-umbriel.el` touches the socket. The buffer and the focus hook are its
two consumers.

Records cited below (`DEC-n` for a decision, `IDE-n` for a backlog idea) open
with `doctrine show <id>`.

## The socket

Every message is one JSON object on one line. The server answers
`{"ok": …}` or `{"err": "…"}`. There are three kinds of connection, all to the
same socket:

```
                       umbriel socket
 query      ──▶ {"cmd":"windows"}                 ──▶ {"ok":[…]}   closes
 action     ──▶ {"cmd":"action","action":"…",…}   ──▶ {"ok":…}     closes
 subscribe  ──▶ {"cmd":"subscribe","events":      ──▶ one snapshot per family,
                 ["windows","workspaces"]}             then one per change; stays open
```

The path is resolved from the environment, as the `umbriel` CLI does:

1. `UMBRIEL_SOCKET`, when set and non-empty (the override);
2. otherwise `$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/umbriel-$WAYLAND_DISPLAY.sock`.

When neither resolves, the failure names the unset variables.

### Reachability from the agent environment

The agent environment can reach this socket from the session shell. Read-only
probes (queries) are fine. Mutating actions (focus, kill, switch, layout) are
the user's to take. Sandboxed (jailed) workers lack the socket. An earlier
SL-016 premise, that no compositor was reachable from the agent environment,
was wrong.

### Why the socket, not the CLI

- Nothing is executed. There is no missing `umbriel` binary, and a dev-shell
  `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` cannot break a subprocess (see `docs/emacs/traps.md`).
- Action fields are typed JSON, not command-line words.
- Errors arrive parsed, as `{"err": …}`, not as an exit status.

All requests are asynchronous: callers pass a callback and nothing blocks.

## The snapshot rule

Both families (`windows`, `workspaces`) arrive as full snapshots. Emacs
replaces the held copy wholesale and never merges, so there is no drift to
reconcile.

```
 compositor ──snapshot──▶ held state ──hook──▶ repaint timer (0.1 s) ──▶ *umbriel*
                          (dl-umbriel.el)      coalesces bursts          redraws only while
                                                                         a window shows it
```

- A repaint is scheduled 0.1 s after a change, so a burst becomes one redraw.
  A buffer nobody displays is marked stale and redrawn when next shown. Point
  and folds survive the redraw.
- The stream ends when the compositor restarts, or when Emacs stops draining
  it and the backlog passes 256 KiB (the compositor drops the connection).
- Nothing reconnects by itself. A closed stream stays closed, so a stale view
  is visible, not silent. The header line says which: `umbriel: stream open`,
  `umbriel: stream never opened`, or the failure message. A count of skipped
  lines (unparseable, an unrequested family, or an event with no data) is
  appended when non-zero.
- `g` in `*umbriel*` reconnects. With the stream open it only repaints.
- Killing `*umbriel*` closes the stream.

Actions do not edit the held state. After a successful action, Emacs waits for
the stream to deliver the effect. With the stream closed it re-queries instead.

## Failure kinds

Every request ends as `(:ok VALUE)` or `(:failure KIND DETAIL)`. Echoed
failures read `umbriel: KIND — DETAIL (remedy)`.

| Kind | Meaning | Remedy |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `no-path` | the socket path cannot be resolved | set `UMBRIEL_SOCKET` |
| `absent` | no socket at that path | is umbriel running in this session? |
| `refused` | a socket, but nothing accepting (stale) | restart umbriel |
| `closed` | the connection ended before a reply | retry; `g` in `*umbriel*` reconnects |
| `rejected` | the compositor answered `{"err": …}` | the compositor refused the request; the detail has its text |
| `malformed` | the reply was not a JSON object | unexpected reply; report upstream |

A multi-step action stops at its first failure.

## The `*umbriel*` buffer

`M-x my/umbriel` (or `C-c u u`) opens it, creating the buffer and the stream
on first use. It is a `magit-section` tree: one section per workspace, its
windows beneath, and a final `Unassigned` section for windows that join no
workspace. Sections fold as usual.

Workspaces are ordered by output, then index. Tiled windows sort by column,
row, tab index, then title, before floating ones. Every compositor-supplied
string (app id, title, name) has newlines and tabs replaced by spaces, so a
row is always one line. Example, with invented names:

```
HDMI-1 1 main scrolling 2 windows active focused
  foot ~/src tile 0,1 active focused visible
  firefox Docs float visible
HDMI-1 2 scrolling 0 windows
```

- Window rows show app id, title, placement (`tile COLUMN,ROW`, bare `tile`
  while the column is unplaced, `float`, `tab INDEX`), then each flag that is set: `active`, `focused`, `visible`,
  `minimized`, `fullscreen`, `urgent`, `xwayland`.
- Workspace rows show output, index, name (named workspaces only), layout, the
  window count, then `active`, `focused`, `urgent`.
- The window count is the number of windows joined under the workspace, not the
  wire's `window_count`, so the label always matches the rows beneath it.
- Columns line up across the whole buffer, headings and window rows each on
  their own stops, except that a heading's marks sit over the rows' flags
  unless the heading's own columns run past them. Over-long app ids and titles are cut with an ellipsis
  (`dl-umbriel-buffer-column-limits`). Alignment is display only: the buffer's
  text is still the single-spaced label, and prompts show the full one.
- `active` and `focused` differ. `active` is seat-global (the window holding
  the keyboard); `focused` is the workspace's remembered focus. A layer
  surface or scratchpad holding the keyboard makes them disagree.
- Window rows are coloured to match: `dl-umbriel-buffer-active-window` (inherits
  `isearch`) on the `active` row, else `dl-umbriel-buffer-focused-window`
  (inherits `highlight`) on a `focused` row. Both span the full line and stay
  visible under magit's point highlight.
- An `active` workspace is shaded darker than `default`:
  `dl-umbriel-buffer-active-workspace-window` on its rows,
  `dl-umbriel-buffer-active-workspace` a step darker on its heading. The shades
  derive from `default` in `core/dl-faces.el`, so they follow the theme, and
  the point highlight and the row colours above show over them.
- Window columns take their colour from `dl-umbriel-buffer-window-app`,
  `-placement` and `-flags`, which inherit theme faces; the `active` and
  `focused` row colours replace them on those rows. An `active` workspace's
  output and index use `dl-umbriel-buffer-active-workspace-id`, bold white.
- `visible` means: on the active workspace, not a hidden tab, not minimized.
  It does not mean "on screen"; such a window may be scrolled out of view.

### Keys

In `*umbriel*`, on the row at point:

| Key | Command | Action sent | Needs |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `RET` | `my/umbriel-focus` | `window-focus` | window row |
| `s` | `my/umbriel-switch` | `workspace-switch` | workspace or window row |
| `m` | `my/umbriel-move-to-workspace` | `window-move-to-workspace-silent` | window row (\*); prompts for the workspace |
| `t` | `my/umbriel-toggle-floating` | `window-toggle-floating` | window row |
| `c` | `my/umbriel-center` | `window-center` | window row (\*) |
| `e` / `E` | `my/umbriel-cycle-extent` / `-back` | `window-cycle-primary-extent[-back]` | window row (\*) |
| `M-<left>` or `<` | `my/umbriel-column-left` | `column-move-left` | window row (\*) |
| `M-<right>` or `>` | `my/umbriel-column-right` | `column-move-right` | window row (\*) |
| `k` | `my/umbriel-kill` | `window-kill` | window row; asks to confirm |
| `L` | `my/umbriel-set-layout` | `workspace-set-layout` | workspace or window row; prompts for the layout |
| `g` | `my/umbriel-refresh` | none | reconnects or repaints |
| `q` | `quit-window` | none | |

(\*) On a workspace row these act on whatever window the compositor has
focused, with no focus step. `RET`, `t` and `k` refuse a workspace row
(`Not a window`).

There are no scroll keys: strip scrolling is a viewport action, not an action
on the row at point (DEC-026). Use umbriel's own bindings.

Global keys, available everywhere under `C-c u` (also `SPC u` on the meow
leader):

| Key | Command | Does |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `C-c u u` | `my/umbriel` | open `*umbriel*` |
| `C-c u w` | `my/umbriel-switch-workspace` | switch workspace, chosen with `completing-read` |
| `C-c u l` | `my/umbriel-set-active-layout` | set the layout of the active workspace on the output under the pointer |
| `C-c u f` | `dl-umbriel-focus-frame` | focus this frame (see below) |

`C-c u w` prompts at once when the stream is open and workspaces are held.
Otherwise it refreshes first and prompts when the reply lands. The workspace
and layout prompts list in display order (workspaces by output, then index;
layouts in a fixed order); recency sorting is switched off for them.

## Addressing

Two kinds of identifier, not interchangeable:

- A **window** is addressed by its opaque `id`.
- A **workspace** is addressed by a selector: its `name` when it is named
  (even if the name is all digits), else its `index`, always with its
  `output`. A window joins its workspace through the workspace's opaque `id`,
  never through the selector.

Some actions take a window id. Others act only on whatever the compositor has
focused. The buffer makes "the row at point" mean what it says by planning the
steps first. The row is captured before any prompt, and a refusal comes before
the prompt, so a refused row never asks anything.

| Addressing | Rows | Requests sent |
| --- | --- | --- |
| window id | `RET`, `t`, `k` | the action, with the row's window id |
| focused | `c`, `e`, `E`, `M-<left>`, `M-<right>`, `m` | `window-focus` row, the action, then `window-focus` back |
| workspace | `s` | `workspace-switch` to the row's workspace |
| active workspace | `L` | `workspace-switch` first, unless already focused, then `workspace-set-layout` |

- **Focus, act, restore.** For a focused-only action on a window that is not
  the focused one, Emacs focuses it, acts, then refocuses the window the
  focused workspace held before (normally this Emacs frame), when that is known
  (DEC-025). Expect a brief flicker. The previous focus comes from held state
  and can be stale if the buffer lags; a vanished window makes the restore
  fail and the failure is echoed. A failed action stops the sequence, so no
  restore is sent. Moving a window to a workspace uses the `-silent` action,
  so focus does not follow it.
- **Layout acts on the output under the pointer.** `workspace-set-layout`
  changes the active workspace of that output. `L` refuses a row on any other
  output. It switches to the row's workspace first only when that workspace is
  not already the focused one: switching to the active workspace would toggle
  back to the previous one under umbriel's `back_and_forth` setting.
- **Refusals.** A heading, an empty buffer or an entry no longer held gives
  `No umbriel row at point`. A window with no workspace cannot be switched to.

### `window-kill` kills the owning process

`k` sends `window-kill`, which terminates the process that owns the window, not
just the window. It asks first, naming the row and the pid. It refuses at once,
before any prompt, if the window is this Emacs; use `delete-frame` there.

## Frame focus

Wayland raises a window only for a client holding an activation token (a
one-time permission the compositor hands out). `emacsclient` brings none, so
when it reuses a frame the server's `select-frame-set-input-focus` can leave
that frame behind the terminal. Only the compositor can focus it.

`dl-umbriel-focus-frame` runs on `server-switch-hook` and on `C-c u f`, for
`pgtk` frames only:

```
 server-switch-hook ──▶ query "windows" ──▶ pick window by (this pid, frame title)
                                        ──▶ action "window-focus" <id>
```

It makes two one-off requests and does not use the held stream, so it works with
no `*umbriel*` buffer. A frame with no match is silent; a failure is echoed.

### Frame identity limits

The match is on pid and title. Two frames showing the same buffer share a
title, so the first match wins and the other frame may not be the one focused.
A reliable fix, giving each frame a unique token title through a creation
handshake, is recorded as IDE-003 (a backlog idea; `doctrine show IDE-003`).

## Emacs holds no layout authority

Emacs shows what the compositor reports and sends requests. It keeps no layout
state of its own and applies no effect locally. Whether a request had an effect
is known only when the next snapshot says so.

## Records

- DEC-016: row actions address by id or selector; focus first where an action
  takes only the focused window.
- DEC-024: key choices. DEC-025: restore previous focus. DEC-026: scroll
  actions dropped.
