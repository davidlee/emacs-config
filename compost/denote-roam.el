;;; Commentary:

;; Some useful extensions for using denote and org-roam to manage your
;; notes.
;;
;; Denote-roam combines the power of org-roam linking and denote
;; system. Denote is intended to be used in this workflow as a means
;; of note creation and management. Org-roam is used for linking
;; between notes and possibly visualizing their relationships with
;; packages like org-roam-ui, although this functionality is outside
;; the scope of this package.
