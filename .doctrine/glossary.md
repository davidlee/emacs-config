## reference forms

How to cite things in prose, commits, and comments. The id is identity; the slug
is never authoritative.

**Entity ids — prefixed, 3-digit zero-padded** (the `abbr` column above):
`SL-020`, `ADR-004`, `PRD-009`, `REQ-059`, `RSK-004`, `ASM-001`. Cite the *durable*
id, never a mobile membership label (`FR-`/`NF-` move per spec — use the `REQ-NNN`
they label).

**Document-local enumerations — bare** (prefix + integer, no zero-pad, no dash):
they are scratch refs within one document, not entity ids.

| ref | meaning | authored in |
|---|---|---|
| `OQ-1` | open question | spec / slice / design |
| `D1`   | decision | design §7 |
| `R1`   | review finding | design §10 |
| `Q1`   | design question | design / slice |
| `C1`   | charge | inquisition |

**Phase ids — `PHASE-01`** (2-digit, immutable; edits append, never renumber). The
sheet *file* is `phase-01.md` (lowercase).

**Criteria ids** (authored in `plan.toml`, immutable; bare, no pad):

| ref | meaning |
|---|---|
| `EN-1` | entry criterion |
| `EX-1` | exit criterion |
| `VT-1` | verification by **test** (automated) |
| `VA-1` | verification by **agent** check |
| `VH-1` | verification by **human** acceptance |

`VT`/`VA`/`VH` are the three verification modes — pick by *who/what* confirms the
criterion. Non-retroactive: existing `VT-` criteria stay valid as "by test."

## folder conventions

 - inside slice folder:
   - ./notes.md
   - ./handover.md
   - ./phases/phase-*.md
 - inside slice, spec or backlog folder:
   - ./research/*
   - ./context/*
